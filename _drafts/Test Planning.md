What is Quality Assurance?

It is the degree to which a system meets specified requirements and  customer expectations. It is also monitoring the processes and products  throughout the SDLC.



SDLC AND STLC



What is SDLC?

Building a software has many process or phases like analysis, design, development, deployment and so on. So this different process that involves from the beginning to the end of software development can be termed as SDLC and its used by the software industry to produce a high-quality s/w in a systematic and cost-effective way. 

Planning > Defining(SRS) > Designing(System arch, er, dfd) > Developent(Coding or imple) > Testing > Deployment and maintenance



STLC

Software Testing Life Cycle

STLC is a sequence of different activities performed by the testing team to ensure the quality of the software or the product.

STLC is an integral part of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

In the early stage of STLC, while the software or the product is  developing, the tester can analyze and define the scope of testing,  entry and exit criteria and also the Test Cases. It helps to reduce the  test cycle time along with better quality.

As soon as the development phase is over, the testers are ready with  test cases and start with execution. This helps to find bugs in the  initial phase.





- **Requirement Analysis** − When the SRD is ready and shared  with the stakeholders, the testing team starts high level analysis  concerning the AUT (Application under Test).
- **Test Planning** − Test Team plans the strategy and approach.
- **Test Case Designing** − Develop the test cases based on scope and criteria’s.
- **Test Environment Setup** − When integrated environment is ready to validate the product.
- **Test Execution** − Real-time validation of product and finding bugs.
- **Test Closure** − Once testing is completed, matrix, reports, results are documented.



### Test Planning 

A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule,  estimation, deliverables, and resources required to perform testing for a software product

As per ISTQB definition: “Test Plan is A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.”

**How to write ?**

1. Analyze the product
2. Design the Test Strategy > (Define Scope of Testing, Identify Testing Type, Document Risk & Issues, 
3. Define the Test Objectives
4. Define Test Criteria
5. Resource Planning
6. Plan Test Environment
7. Schedule & Estimation
8. Determine Test Deliverables
