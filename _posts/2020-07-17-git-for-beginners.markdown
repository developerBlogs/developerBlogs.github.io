# What is Git and Why Use it?
You have just started to work on a project, integrated an awesome feature to it and you released it. So, what you have now is a 
initial version of your project (Version 1.0). Lets say you added a new feature to it, now 

you have a new version for it (Version 1.1). <!--more--> A project can have
many versions like this with continous changes to it. So, you will need a system or tools to track the changes made in your project by you or your teammates, a sytem which can help you to go back and forth to the different versions. Basically what you need is a sytem that can control many versions of your project,and Git is basically that a Version Control System.

## Why Use It? 
Git is one of many version control system and mostly the preferable one by many people.

####  1. Easy Distribution of your Project.<br/>
        Chong: Hey man what's you doing?
        Cheech: I am creating a zip file for my latest code and sharing it to my friends.
        Chong: What? Why? Dont you know about version control system such as Git?
        Cheech: No, whats that?

Thats right, if you dont know anything about Version Control System this might be how you are sharing or distributing the latest version of your project with your friends/team? 
So, thats why you should use Git right now. Cause your way is frustating and it sucks.
You can use Git in your repository/project and just upload it to the version control repository hosting service such as Github or Bitbucket.
Then you can share the link of your project to your friends or team so they can now clone(download) your repository into their local system.

Sounds somewhat similar like? Just like you uploading your zipped project into Google Drive and sharing the sharable link. But trust me its not the same.
You dont have to go through all the hassle and trouble like zipping your project everytime and getting the sharable link every f**ing time.
You just need to type some few easy commands and you have pushed/uploaded your latest version of the project into github or bitbucket.
Simillarly your friends also just need to write a git command to pull/download this latest version to their local sytem.

### 2. Resolve conflicts.<br/>
    Chong: Hey man whats wrong?
    Cheech: One of my team just changed the same file I was working on and now
             we dont know which one should we keep and which one to delete.
    Chong: See, I told you to use Git. There would have been no any such problems.

If you have a team working on a same project, there there can come many cases where more than two person are changing the same code.
For example you just created a function in file something.js and one of your teammate came and created another function with the same name or he changed statement inside your function. After few days only you came to know about these changes and now you are sitting their confused who made the changes and when.

Using Git will resolves such issues.It gives you features where you can keep the log/track of your changes know when, where and who made the changes. If you are the owner/admin of the repository you will have the authority to merge the changes your friend made or just discard them. 


### 3. You can revert and go back to older version of your code.
    Cheech: Hey man, can you help me ?
    Chong: Sure, man what's the problem?
    Cheech: We have been working on this project and the latest version was unnecessary now we want to go
            back to the old version of the project. So I have to find and delete every unnecessary
            changes now.Is there any easy way? 
    Chong: Yes, Git is the easy way. Git is goooood.

Indeed, git is good. It lets you jump to any version of your project easily with out any problems at all.

### 4. Branches for your features. 
    Cheech: Hey man, can you help me ?
    Chong: Sure, man what's the problem?
    Cheech: I want to add this new feature on the project but i dont want to keep the copy of my present 
            project somewhere safe.
    Chong: Dude are you saying me you are still not using Git? Whats wrong with you?

No matter how big or small the changes is you just dont want to mess up the present stable code. So with git you can just create a new feature branch and start working in it without changing you old code which lies in master branch.

### 5. You will end up needing git eventually.
There might be no any software companies out their who will not be using any version control system. So, its better to learn git before being hired to a company and have more chance to get hired.
