<div class="">
<hr>
  Just like  `binding.pry` in ruby on rails we can use `IEx.pry` in eixir/phoenix.  
  
  ```ruby
  def fun_name(arguments) do
    require IEx; IEx.pry
    ...
  end
  ```

  In order for this to work we need to start the server through IEx. ```iex -S mix phoenix.server```

  In order for this to work we need to start the server through IEx.
